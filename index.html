		<h3> ...and finally Number 19! </h3>
		<p> We're shifting this one back to the Raven side of the corvidae family, and arguably my favourite characters in mythology. Huginn & Muninn! From Norse mythology Huginn (old norse for &quot;thought&quot;) and Muninn (old norse for &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;mind&quot;) are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world and bring back information to Odin. </p>
